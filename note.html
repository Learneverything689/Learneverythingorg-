<p><h1 style="color:red">ALKANOLS</h1>
Alkanols are a group of compounds containing the hydroxyl (-OH) group. They form a homologous series with the general molecular formula CnH2n+1OH or (CnH2n+2O), where n is equal to or greater than 1. Alkanols are regarded as being derived from alkanes by substituting one or more hydrogen atoms with hydroxyl groups. The hydroxyl group (-OH) is the functional group of the alkanol. The general formula of the monohydric alkanol can be written as ROH, where R is the alkyl or phenyl group. Alkanols are named by dropping the end -e of the corresponding alkane and replacing it with -ol. The simplest member of the series is methanol, sometimes known as wood spirit because it was produced by the destructive distillation of wood. It is poisonous and can cause blindness if consumed. Ethanol (alcohol) is the second member of the series and by far the most important.</p>
<p style="color:red">Classification of alkanols based on the number of hydroxyl (-OH) groups</p>
<ul>
  <li>Monohydric alkanol</li>
  <li>Dihydric alkanol</li>
  <li>Trihydric alkanol</li>
</ul>
<p style="color:red">Classification of alkanols based on the number of alkyl groups</p>
<p>The general formula is ROH where R is the alkyl group. There are three types of alkanols based on this classification:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Primary alkanol: has only one alkyl group attached to the carbon atom that carries the hydroxyl group.</li>
  <li>Secondary alkanol: has two alkyl groups attached to the carbon atom that carries the hydroxyl group.</li>
  <li>Tertiary alkanol: has three alkyl groups attached to the carbon atom that carries the hydroxyl group.</li>
</ul>
<p style="color:red">Properties of -OH group as a functional group:</p>
<p>Alkanols, e.g., ethanol, are more reactive than the corresponding alkanes. The increase in reactivity is due to the presence of the -OH group, which is the functional group.</p>
<p style="color:red">ETHANOL</p>
<p>Ethanol has the molecular formula C2H5OH and the structure. It is a primary alkanol and a very important compound because it has more uses than almost any other organic compound. It is commonly called alcohol.</p>
<p style="color:red">Laboratory preparation of ethanol</p>
<p>Ethanol can be prepared in the laboratory by:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Hydration of ethene</li>
  <li>Reducing ethanal with nascent hydrogen in the presence of a platinum catalyst</li>
  <li>Hydrolysing iodoethane with an alkali</li>
  <li>Hydrolysing ethyl esters with a hot alkali</li>
</ul>
<p style="color:red">Industrial preparation of ethanol</p>
<p>Commercially, ethanol is prepared from ethene and by fermentation.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Preparation from ethene: The ethene is concentrated, absorbed in first tetraoxosulphate (VI) acid at 8°C and 30 atm to form ethyl hydrogen tetraoxosulphate (VI). This is then hydrolysed by boiling with water. The ethanol formed is distilled off, leaving the acid which can be concentrated and used again.</li>
  <li>Preparation by fermentation: Ethanol results from the fermentation of sugar. Fermentation is the slow decomposition of large organic molecules (starch) by microorganisms (e.g., yeast and bacteria) into smaller molecules (ethanol). In the fermentation process, enzymes secreted by these microorganisms act as catalysts for the breakdown of sugar molecules. The most important reaction is the conversion of glucose to ethanol by the enzymes zymase.</li>
</ul>
<p style="color:red">Materials used in ethanol production</p>
<p>In practice, glucose is not the starting material.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Potatoes, cassava, and cereals: The starchy food is crushed and treated with steam to extract the starch granules. Malt is added at 55°C for one hour. (Malt is a partially germinated barley which contains the enzyme diastase). This enzyme converts starch into maltose. Yeast is then added at room temperature to release maltase, which converts maltose into glucose. Enzymes zymase, which is also present in yeast, convert the glucose into ethanol and carbon dioxide.</li>
  <li>From sugarcane: The part of sugarcane used is called molasses, a liquid that remains after crystallization of sugar from sugarcane. The molasses contain sucrose. Yeast, which contains the enzyme invertase, is added to convert sucrose into glucose and fructose. These are later converted into ethanol by the enzyme zymase.</li>
  <li>From palm wine: The ethanol produced from palm wine is known as illicit gin. Palm wine, which contains primarily both sugar and yeast, is allowed to stand for 4 days, during which the yeast ferments sugar to produce ethanol. This is then distilled to give alcohol.</li>
  <li>From cellulose: Cellulose and cellulose wastes are good and cheap sources of ethanol. They are hydrolyzed with dilute acids, e.g., tetraoxosulphate (VI), to obtain sugar. The sugar is separated and converted into ethanol by fermentation, using yeast as a source of the enzyme. The ethanol is separated and collected by fractional distillation at 78°C. Further distillation in the presence of quicklime yields absolute ethanol (95%).</li>
</ol>
<p>The brewing process: Brewing is the process employed in the production of alcoholic beverages. Barley is partially germinated to produce malt, which is employed in the fermentation. Beer is essentially a dilute solution of ethyl alcohol and carbohydrates in water. Beer can be made by fermenting sugar from malt and adding dried flower of the hop plant to produce the characteristic flavor. If the sugar comes from grape juice, the product is wine. Most beer and wine contain 5-15% ethanol. Distillation of wine produces brandy, while distillation of fermented grain produces whiskey.</p>
<p style="color:red">Physical properties of ethanol</p>
<ol>
  <li>Ethanol is a colorless, volatile liquid with a characteristic taste and smell.</li>
  <li>It is readily soluble in water in all proportions.</li>
  <li>It has a boiling point of 78°C.</li>
  <li>It is neutral to litmus.</li>
</ol>
<p>The physical properties, such as the boiling point and solubility of alkanols, are affected by the presence of hydrogen bonding. The hydroxyl group is capable of bonding to other alkanol molecules. The boiling and melting points rise steadily with increasing molecular mass. Hydrogen bonding causes the molecules to stick together. For example, comparing the boiling point of n-pentane (36°C) with that of butan-1-ol (118°C), the boiling point of the alkanol is much higher even though the two compounds have similar relative molecular mass. This is due to the presence of hydrogen bonds in butanol. Generally, hydrocarbons are not soluble in water, but alkanols are soluble because the hydroxyl groups in their molecules can form hydrogen bonds with water. Solubility and volatility decrease as the number of carbon atoms increases in alkanols because the molecules are stuck together due to hydrogen bonding, making them difficult to separate and driven off into the vapor phase. Primary alkanols with more than five carbon atoms are insoluble in water.</p>
<p style="color:red">Chemical properties of ethanol</p>
<ol>
  <li>Combustion: Ethanol burns in air or oxygen with a pale-blue flame, yielding water and carbon dioxide.</li>
  <li>Reaction with sodium and potassium: Ethanol reacts with sodium at room temperature to produce hydrogen and sodium ethoxide. On evaporating the solution, a white deliquescent solid known as sodium ethoxide is left behind. Sodium ethoxide is rapidly hydrolyzed by cold water to give an alkaline solution. Metallic potassium gives a similar reaction with ethanol.</li>
  <li>Reaction with the chlorides of phosphorus: Ethanol reacts vigorously with phosphorus (V) chloride at room temperature to liberate a steamy fume of hydrogen chloride and chloroethane vapor. Phosphorus (III) chloride gives a similar but less vigorous reaction.</li>
  <li>Oxidation: Ethanol under favorable conditions is readily oxidized to ethanal by warming with potassium dichromate (VI) solution, which has been acidified with dilute sulfuric acid. Further oxidation in the presence of excess sulfuric acid converts ethanol to ethanoic acid. Generally, primary alkanols are oxidized to alkanals and carboxylic acids, secondary alkanols to ketones, while tertiary alkanols are not oxidized.</li>
  <li>Esterification: Alkanols react reversibly with carboxylic acids in the presence of a mineral acid to form alkanoates (esters). The process is known as esterification. Alkanol + acid ester + water. E.g., ethanol reacts with ethanoic acid to give ethyl ethanoate.</li>
  <li>Dehydration: With excess concentrated sulfuric acid at 180°C, ethanol reacts to form ethyl hydrogen sulfate, which then decomposes to yield ethene. If, on the other hand, the alkanol is in excess at a lower temperature, it will react with the ethyl hydrogen sulfate to yield diethyl ether. The formation of ethene and diethyl ether from ethanol can be considered as dehydration reactions because the overall reactions involve the loss of one molecule of water from one molecule and two molecules of ethanol, respectively.</li>
</ol>
<p style="color:red">Uses of ethanol</p>
<ol>
  <li>Ethanol is a useful solvent for the production of perfumes, varnishes, soaps, paints, dyes, drugs, and flavoring extracts.</li>
  <li>It is a starting material used in the manufacture of many important compounds e.g., ethanal, ethanoic acid, ethyl ester, and diethyl ether.</li>
  <li>It is used as a fuel, either by itself or mixed with petrol in racing cars and rockets.</li>
  <li>It is used as an antifreeze in automobile radiators because it has a low freezing point of -117°C.</li>
  <li>It is used as an antiseptic in:
    <ul>
      <li>Surgical spirits for hardening skins and in the treatment of pimples.</li>
      <li>Sterilization, such as cleaning skins before injection.</li>
      <li>Preservation of biological specimens and food.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>It is used in ship's compasses, spirit levels, and in thermometers designed to measure low temperatures.</li>

            <p>. <header style="color:red">PERIODIC TABLE</header>



<p style="color:red" >Historical Development of the Periodic Table:</p>
The concept of organizing elements into a systematic table dates back to the works of various scientists in the 19th century. Dmitri Mendeleev is often credited with the development of the modern periodic table in 1869. He arranged elements by atomic mass and noted recurring patterns in their properties. Mendeleev's table left gaps for undiscovered elements and successfully predicted the properties of these missing elements. This paved the way for the modern understanding of the periodic table.

<p style="color:red" >Features of the Periodic Table:</p>
The periodic table is a visual representation of the chemical elements arranged in order of increasing atomic number. Elements are organized into periods (rows) and groups (columns) based on shared properties. The table provides valuable information about an element's atomic structure, electron configuration, and chemical behavior. Elements in the same group exhibit similar properties due to their shared electron configurations, allowing for predictions of an element's reactivity and physical characteristics.

<p style="color:red" >Metal, Non-Metals, and the Periodic Table:</p>
The periodic table categorizes elements into different groups based on their properties. Metals are found on the left side of the table and tend to be shiny, malleable, and good conductors of heat and electricity. Non-metals, on the other hand, are located on the right side of the table and often have properties opposite to metals, such as being brittle and poor conductors. Metalloids, which display properties of both metals and non-metals, are found along the zig-zag line dividing the table.

<p style="color:red" >Periodicity of Fundamental Properties:</p>
One of the key features of the periodic table is the periodicity of fundamental properties. This refers to the recurring trends in an element's properties based on its position in the table. For example, atomic radius generally decreases across a period from left to right due to increasing nuclear charge, while it increases down a group due to additional electron shells. This periodic variation extends to other properties such as ionization energy, electronegativity, and chemical reactivity.<p style="color:red" >1. Atomic Radius:</p>
Atomic radius refers to the size of an atom, typically measured as the distance from the nucleus to the outermost electron shell. Across a period (row) on the periodic table, atomic radius generally decreases from left to right due to increasing nuclear charge pulling the electrons closer. Down a group (column), atomic radius increases as additional electron shells are added.

<p style="color:red" >2. Ionization Energy:</p>
Ionization energy is the energy required to remove an electron from an atom. Across a period, ionization energy tends to increase from left to right due to stronger nuclear attraction on the electrons. Down a group, ionization energy typically decreases as electrons are farther from the nucleus and experience weaker attraction.

<p style="color:red" >3. Electronegativity:</p>
Electronegativity is the tendency of an atom to attract electrons in a chemical bond. Across a period, electronegativity generally increases from left to right as atoms gain electrons to achieve a stable configuration. Down a group, electronegativity tends to decrease due to the increasing distance between the nucleus and the valence electrons.

<p style="color:red" >4. Metallic Character:</p>
Metallic character refers to an element's ability to exhibit metallic properties such as conductivity, malleability, and luster. Across a period, metallic character decreases from left to right as elements become more non-metallic. Down a group, metallic character increases as elements become more metallic in nature.

<p style="color:red" >5. Reactivity:</p>
Reactivity describes how readily an element undergoes chemical reactions. Elements in the same group tend to exhibit similar reactivity due to their shared electron configurations. For example, alkali metals in Group 1 are highly reactive as they readily lose their outermost electron to achieve a stable electronic configuration.
<p style="color:red" >6.Electron Affinity </p>

   - Shows periodic trends across the periodic table.
   - Elements on the right side tend to have higher electron affinities due to high electronegativity.
   - Elements on the left side have lower electron affinities.

<p style="color:red" >7.Electrical and Thermal Conductivity:</p>
   - Metals (left side) have high electrical and thermal conductivity.
   - Presence of free electrons allows easy movement of heat and electricity.
   - Non-metals exhibit lower conductivity.
   
  <p style="color:red" >8. Melting and Boiling Points</p>
   - Metals generally have high melting and boiling points compared to non-metals.
   - Strong metallic bonding in metals requires more energy to break apart.
   - Weaker intermolecular forces in non-metals result in lower melting and boiling points.

Underlying Factors
   - Atomic size, effective nuclear charge, and electron configuration influence these properties.
   - Trends in atomic structure across and down the periodic table explain the periodicity observed in these fundamental properties.


Understanding the periodic trends in these fundamental properties can provide valuable insights into an element's behavior, chemical reactivity, and the relationships between different elements on the periodic table.

<p style="color:red" >Families of Elements</p>:
The periodic table is divided into families or groups of elements that share similar properties. Each group is designated by a specific number and letter symbol, such as the alkali metals (Group 1), alkaline earth metals (Group 2), halogens (Group 17), and noble gases (Group 18). Elements within the same group often exhibit comparable chemical behaviors due to their shared electron configurations, making it easier to predict their reactivity and interactions with other elements.</br>

<p style="color:red" >PERIODIC LAW</p>
The Periodic Law is a cornerstone principle in chemistry which states that the physical and chemical properties of elements are periodic functions of their atomic numbers. This law gave rise to the creation of the periodic table, a systematic arrangement of elements based on their properties.

<p style="color:red" >NOBLE GASES</p>
Noble gases, also known as inert gases, are extremely unreactive due to their stable electron configurations. These gases have a full outer electron shell, making them highly stable and reluctant to form chemical bonds with other elements. This electron configuration results in a minimal tendency to gain, lose, or share electrons, thus rendering noble gases nonreactive under normal conditions. Examples of noble gases include Helium, Neon, Argon, Krypton, Xenon, and Radon.

 <p style="color:red" >TRANSITION ELEMENTS</p>
Transition elements are positioned in the d-block of the periodic table. They exhibit distinctive characteristics such as the presence of incomplete d-orbitals and the ability to create colored compounds. Transition elements commonly display multiple oxidation states, participate in various types of chemical reactions, and showcase catalytic properties. Prominent transition elements include iron, copper, and chromium.

<p style="color:red" >INNER TRANSITION ELEMENTS</p>
Inner transition elements, found in the f-block of the periodic table, consist of the lanthanides and actinides series. These elements possess electron configurations that fill the f-orbitals and are recognized for their radioactive properties. Notable inner transition elements encompass uranium, plutonium, and neodymium.

<p style="color:red" >DIAGONAL RELATIONSHIP</p>
The diagonal relationship within the periodic table denotes similarities in properties between elements positioned diagonally across from each other. For instance, elements like lithium and magnesium exhibit resemblances in properties despite belonging to different groups due to their placement in the periodic table. This phenomenon can be attributed to comparable charge-to-size ratios and can impact the reactions and compound formation of these elements.

<p style="color:red" >11.2 RATES OF CHEMICAL REACTIONS</p>

In chemistry, the understanding of basic concepts such as reactants, products, reaction time, and reaction rate is crucial in studying chemical reactions. Let's delve into these fundamental aspects and then introduce the collision theory, which provides insights into the factors influencing reaction rates.</br>

1. Reactants: Reactants are the substances that participate in a chemical reaction and are consumed during the process. They undergo chemical changes and transform into products. The nature and amount of reactants influence the outcome of the reaction.</br>


2. Products: Products are the new substances formed as a result of a chemical reaction. They are produced from the reactants through the breaking and forming of chemical bonds. The properties and quantities of products are determined by the reactants and the reaction conditions.</br>


3. Reaction Time: Reaction time refers to the duration it takes for a chemical reaction to reach completion or equilibrium. Some reactions are rapid and occur within seconds, while others may take hours, days, or even longer to proceed to completion. Factors such as reactant concentrations, temperature, and the presence of catalysts influence reaction times.</br>


4. Reaction Rate: The reaction rate is the speed at which reactants are converted into products in a chemical reaction. It is expressed as the change in concentration of reactants or products per unit time. Reaction rates depend on various factors, including reactant concentrations, temperature, pressure, surface area, and the presence of catalysts.</br>



The rate of a chemical reaction is defined as the number of moles of a reactant converted or product formed per unit time. It represents the rate of change in the concentration of reactants or products over time, indicating the speed at which a chemical reaction proceeds. This can be measured by taking a set mass of a reactant, such as zinc, adding an excess of another reactant like hydrochloric acid, and recording the time taken for the reaction to complete.</br>

    <p><a href="curve.jpeg">
         <img style="max-width: 100%; /* Set maximum width to prevent image overflow */
        height: auto; /* Maintain image aspect ratio */
        display: block; /* Ensure the image is displayed as a block element */
        margin: 0 auto; /* Center the image horizontally on the page */
    }
" src="curve.jpeg" alt="LIST OF CLASSES"></a></p>

A rate curve graph illustrates the rate of reaction over time. The curve typically starts at the origin since there is no mass loss initially. The gradient of the curve decreases as the reaction slows down, eventually becoming horizontal when one of the reactants is completely consumed. A steeper gradient indicates a faster reaction rate, while a gentler slope signifies a slower reaction.</br>

    <p class="red-text">11.3 COLLISION THEORY</p>
    <p>The collision theory explains that for a chemical reaction to occur, reacting particles must collide with sufficient energy and the correct orientation. Not every collision between reactant particles leads to a reaction; only a small fraction of collisions are effective. The minimum energy needed for a successful collision is called the activation energy, representing the energy barrier that must be surpassed for the reaction to proceed.</p>

    <p>When colliding particles possess energy equal to or greater than the activation energy, they form a high-energy transitional state known as the activated complex. This unstable complex subsequently decomposes to yield the reaction products. Activation energy is specific to each reaction, with reactions having low activation energy occurring spontaneously at room temperature and those with high activation energy requiring external energy input, often in the form of heat.</p>

    <p>A reaction profile displays the energy changes throughout a reaction, depicting how reactants progress through activated complexes to form products, illustrating energy shifts in exothermic and endothermic reactions. The collision theory can be employed to elucidate how variations in temperature, concentration, the nature of reactants, and the presence of catalysts influence the rates of chemical reactions.</p>
