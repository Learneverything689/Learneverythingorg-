            <h2>What is Reverse Engineering?</h2>
            <p>Reverse engineering is the process of deconstructing and analyzing a product to understand how it works, without having access to its design or documentation. It involves examining the components, functions, and behavior of the product to gain insights into its structure and operation. Reverse engineering is commonly used in various fields such as software development, mechanical engineering, and electronics.</p>
