            <p> 1. A student is conducting a titration experiment to determine the concentration of acetic acid in a vinegar sample. If it took 25 mL of 0.1 MNaOH solution to neutralize 30 mL of the vinegar sample, what is the molarity of acetic acid in the vinegar?</br>

2. In a calorimetry experiment, 50.0 g of water at 25°C is mixed with 50.0 g of water at 45°C. If the final temperature of the mixture is 35°C, calculate the heat capacity of the calorimeter.</br>

3. A gas sample occupies a volume of 2.50 L at a pressure of 1.00 atm and a temperature of 25°C. If the temperature is increased to 50°C and the pressure is reduced to 0.800 atm, what is the new volume of the gas sample?</br>

4. Calculate the pH of a solution with a hydrogen ion concentration of 1.0 x 10^-9 M.</br>

5. A solution contains 0.050 moles of solute dissolved in 500 mL of solvent. Calculate the molarity of the solution.</br></p>
